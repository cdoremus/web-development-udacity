Instructor Comments:
Everything from usersignup_main.py - the following was added in bold to the bottom
regarding the Path attribute of Set-Cookie:
The default Path for a cookie is the current path, which is probably not what you want. 
The Path parameter should be / as in our example.    


Video Notes:
Logout url deletes the cookie and redirects to the signup page
